# Small_Tasks
The scripts in this directory will have a Language 7 version listed atop the script.  
You will find that almost everything I create is in Python 3.4 or later.  
I am learning Python 3, so if you find room for improvement, please share.  
  
This repository contains small scripts for doing repeatable tasks
