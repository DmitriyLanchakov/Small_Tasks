# Small_Tasks
The scripts in this directory will have a Language and version listed atop the script.  
You will find that almost everything I create is in Python 3.4 or later and that it is created with Windows users in mind.  Why? Because companies buy their SOC Windows workstations and this just makes life easier for them and I am still learning Linux.   
  
I am learning Python 3, so if you find room for improvement, please share.  
  
This repository contains small scripts for doing repeatable tasks
